![bank](images/intro.png)

Compare performance of various classifiers we encountered in this section namely Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees and SVM. 
We will utilize a banking marketing campaign dataset to achieve this. This is a solution for practical assignment 17.1 (BHPCMLAI)

### Summary of findings

Decision Tree came out as the best performing model amongst all the models for this dataset with an accuracy score of 91.2%. This can be seen in the below dataframe snapshot and the ROC curve.
